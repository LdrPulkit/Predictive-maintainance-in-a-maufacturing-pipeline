# Data-driven-productivity-enhancement
The objective of this project is to study various processes involved in the whole product-manufacturing pipeline and eventually develop data-driven deep learning based solutions to improve them. Special attention will be given to predictive maintenance, in order to improve quality by improving response mechanism.
